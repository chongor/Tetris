Tetris
======

Course Programming Project: implementation of the classic game Tetris in Java.

I recreated the old classic video game Tetris.
The entire game was written by myself for a final project assignment for a Computer Science Programming course.

Tetrominoes are drawn with Swing, a Java GUI widget toolkit.  The other graphics were found off google images.  The sound effects were also found from the internet.  And the song in the background is the tetris main theme song.
